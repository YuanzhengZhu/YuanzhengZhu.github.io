    <p>
      In 2014, Rem Koolhaas, guest curator of the 14th International Architecture
      Exhibition at the Venice Biennale, organized this six-month event under the
      theme of “Fundamentals.” In particular, the exhibition curated by Koolhaas
      himself, “Elements of Architecture,” is instrumental for its historical study
       of fifteen supposedly elemental components of architecture.1 <span>1</span>
       One of these
       fifteen elements, the corridor, was presented through a research project
       vdirected by Stephan Trüby.2
